# README.md 


Package your entire codebase into a single, LLM-friendly file. This tool scans a project directory and aggregates all source code, configuration, and text files into one comprehensive context file, streamlining the process of prompting Large Language Models.


This tool is designed to simplify feeding entire software projects into Large Language Models. It recursively scans a project directory, gathering all relevant text files (such as source code, markdown, and configuration files) and consolidates their contents into a single, well-structured text file. This eliminates the need to upload numerous files individually, providing the LLM with a complete and holistic view of the project's architecture and logic.

# Quick Build-up Environment


# 
```bash

# 在專案根目錄建立虛擬環境執行
python3 -m venv .venv


# 若使用 `uv` 管理專案則執行以下指令
uv python install ">3.10, <=3.11"
uv puthon pin ">3.10, <=3.11"
uv venv


# 啟用虛擬環境 (macOS / Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate


# 若使用 Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

```


# 
```bash

pip install "pytest" "flake8" "pydocstyle[google]" "isort"

# 說明：pydocstyle[google] 會額外安裝支援 Google 風格檢查的元件。
